This repository holds the Blogged-Website development code<br />

Client code is written using ReactJS (deployment code for client: https://github.com/James-T-Ardian/Blogged-Website-Client) and deployed using Netlify<br />

Server Code is written using NodeJS, ExpressJS and MySQL and deployed using Heroku<br /> (NO PUBLIC DEPLOYMENT CODE, SEE NOTE BELOW FOR EXPLANATION)

Note: There are some changes in deployment code as compared to development code. For client code changes, see deployment repository's readme file. For server changes, I changed mysql credentials to use the mysql deployed at Heroku (since mysql credentials for Heroku shall be kept a secret, I will not put the server deployment code in a public repository).

Deployed Website: https://blogged-website.netlify.app/# <br />



ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT NOTE: THE DEVELOPMENT CODE IS CURRENTLY BEING MIGRATED FROM JAVASCRIPT TO TYPESCRIPT
